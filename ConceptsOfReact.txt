 (3)  JSX  

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It is an extensible syntax that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

       const HomePage = () =>{

(7) What are Props?

Props (properties) are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.
They are used to transfer data and configure components dynamically.

A Prop Interface is used to define the expected data structure of props in TypeScript.
This ensures type safety and improves auto-suggestion in editors.
