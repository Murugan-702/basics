 
 (1)  React 

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, mainly for creating Single Page Applications (SPA).
It allows developers to build complex UIs using small, reusable pieces called components.


 (2)  Functions (Functional Components) 

In React, a function or functional component is a reusable block of code that returns UI elements.
 
 (3)  JSX  

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It is an extensible syntax that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.


 (4) TSX  

TSX stands for TypeScript XML.
It is JSX with TypeScript support, allowing type-safe React applications.


 (5)   How to Create a React App (Vite)   

     npm create vite@latest 

     TypeScript

(6)  Creation of Function
       

       const HomePage = () =>{
              return(
                 <> Home Page </>
              )
       }

(7) What are Props?

Props (properties) are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.
They are used to transfer data and configure components dynamically.


(8) Prop Interface (TypeScript / TSX)

A Prop Interface is used to define the expected data structure of props in TypeScript.
This ensures type safety and improves auto-suggestion in editors.

(9)  Props Drilling 
  Props Drilling happens when you pass props through multiple nested components just to reach a deeply nested child, 
  even if intermediate components don’t use the data.

(10)  Props Spreading
      Props spreading allows you to pass all props of an object at 
once using the spread operator (...).

(11)  Avatar Component

An Avatar Component is a small UI element used to display a
 user’s profile picture, initials, or icon. It is commonly used in social media apps, chat apps, dashboards, and user profiles.

 (12) Custom Component and asChild 

 (13) Component Composition
 Component Composition is a React design pattern where multiple smaller components are combined together to build a bigger or more complex UI component.

    Instead of writing one large component, React encourages breaking UI into reusable, independent components and then composing them together.
